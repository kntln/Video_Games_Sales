![Video Games](https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gridoffset-videogames-1-1585583517.jpg)

## Overview of the Project
 For this project, we have selected to analyze video games sales. We have chosen this topic because we are interested in looking at factors affecting video game sales such as genre, developer, critic score, platform and ESRB rating.The first dataset was collected from the Kaggle dataset. There are 55,792 records in the dataset as of April 12th, 2019. It was generated by a scrape of vgchartz.com. The second data set contains information about video-games publishers.

The questions we hope to answer from the analysis are as follows:
- What is overall trend of global sales for video games
- How do factors such as genre, critic score, and developer affect video games sales?
- Can we make a prediction about video games sales based on the following factors mentioned above? 

## ETL
![ETL](https://github.com/kntln/Movies-ETL/blob/main/Resources/ETL.png)

### Extract:
The datasets that will be used for this analysis are:
Video Game Sales Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashaheedq/video-games-sales-2019

Videogames-companies-regions Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andreshg/videogamescompaniesregions

We downloaded the data and using Jupyter Notebook, we loaded the data using Pandas dataframe. The two datasets were merged using left join. 

### Transform:
For the data transformation, We used .count and .columns to review the data. After that we dropped  “Developer_y','NA_Sales','PAL_Sales','JP_Sales','Other_Sales because they are irrelevant to our analysis. We found that total_shipped and global sales also represent the total sales so we added them up and converted it to a new column Total_sales”. We found that there are substantial null values for some of the columns so we decided to drop the whole column as well since they are not relevant. They are “ESRB_Rating','Critic_Score','User_Score', and 'Country'. We also found that there are 35930 rows with $0 sales, so we have to drop them as well since they won’t provide any result when we are doing comparison based on Sales. We also drop rows only with the NaN value in Developer_x and Year since they only have 17 and 979 null values out of 55792 rows.

### Load:

We are planning to load our database using AWS and RDS. After creating RDS, we are connecting that to postgresQL for storage. We will be using Tableau to present our analysis for visualization.
